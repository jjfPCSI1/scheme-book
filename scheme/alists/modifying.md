# Modifying alists

As seen in the previous chapter Scheme provides commands to retrieve elements
from association lists although this could also be done using regular list
operations.  The same is true for adding and setting elements in alists.  While
it would surely be a good exercise to go through the process in detail you are
still lacking some basics, in particular [conditionals](../conditionals.html),
so we're sticking to Scheme's dedicated procedures (which you'll be using in
general anyway).

## Adding an Entry

There is one procedure that simply adds an entry to an association list:

```
acons <key> <value> <alist>
```

(as a shortname for “cons an alist”).  This creates a pair of the given key and
value and “conses” this pair to the alist, returning a new alist with the new
key prepended:

```
guile> (define bool-alist
       '((subdivide . #t)
         (use-color . #f)))

guile> bool-alist
((subdivide . #t) (use-color . #f))

guile> (acons 'debug #f bool-alist)
((debug . #f) (subdivide . #t) (use-color . #f))

guile> bool-alist
((subdivide . #t) (use-color . #f))
```

From the last expression you can see that the original alist is not modified by
this, instead a copy of the combined alist is returned.  So if we want to keep
the new alist for further use we have to bind it to some other variable (which
we'll see in more detail in [Binding](../binding.html)) or use the following
syntax to assign the result to the original variable:

```
guile> (set! bool-alist
        (acons 'debug #f bool-alist))

guile> bool-alist
((debug . #f) (subdivide . #t) (use-color . #f))
```

As said above `acons` simply prepends a new pair, without checking for existing
elements with the same key.  When you now try to retrieve the entry for such a
duplicate entry `assq` will return the *first* pair with the matching key:

```
guile> (set! bool-alist
        (acons 'subdivide #f bool-alist))
guile> bool-alist
((subdivide . #f) (debug . #f) (subdivide . #t) (use-color . #f))

guile> (assq 'subdivide bool-alist)
(subdivide . #f)
```

As it is rather uncommon to have association lists with non-unique keys Scheme
also provides a procedure to *add or update* a list element:


## Adding or Updating List Elements

Scheme provides a set of three procedures to *add or update* entries in an
alist.  As with the procedures retrieving elements from alists the three
variants refer to three levels of equality that are applied for matching the
given pair to potentially existing elements. If the keys in the alist are
symbols the procedure to use is

```
assq-set! <alist> <key> <value>
```

otherwise you may have to use `assv-set!` or `assoc-set!` and - again -
familiarize yourself with the different levels of equality in Scheme.  (Again:
please note the different order of arguments as compared to `acons`.)

The procedure first checks if the alist already contains an entry with the given
key.  If it does it replaces the value for that key, so the original alist is
updated:

```
guile> (assq-set! bool-alist 'debug #t)
((subdivide . #f) (debug . #t) (subdivide . #t) (use-color . #f))

guile> bool-alist
((subdivide . #f) (debug . #t) (subdivide . #t) (use-color . #f))
```

When the procedure does *not* find the key already present it prepends a new
element, just as `acons` does:

```
guile> (assq-set! bool-alist 'color red)
((color 1.0 0.0 0.0) (subdivide . #f) (debug . #t) (subdivide . #t) (use-color . #f))

guile> bool-alist
((subdivide . #f) (debug . #t) (subdivide . #t) (use-color . #f))
```

But please note that - again as with `acons` in this case the original alist is
*not* updated and a new copy returned instead.  So again you have to self-assign
the updated list:

```
guile> (set! bool-alist
        (assq-set! bool-alist 'color red))

guile> bool-alist
((color 1.0 0.0 0.0) (subdivide . #f) (debug . #t) (subdivide . #t) (use-color . #f))
```

More details and examples can be found on the [reference
page](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/docs/docs-1.8/guile-ref/Adding-or-Setting-Alist-Entries.html#Adding-or-Setting-Alist-Entries).

## Removing Entries from an alist

 The missing third part is how to remove existing elements from alists.
 Probably you won't be surprised by now that this can be achieved using the
 procedure

 ```
 assq-remove! <alist> <key>
 ```

 and its companions `assv-remove!` and `assoc-remove!`.  You should understand
 that what `assq-remove!` actually does is making sure the given key isn't
 present in the returned alist.  So if you give it a non-existent key the
 procedure simply does nothing, without any further notification:

 ```
 guile> (assq-remove! bool-alist 'subdivide)
((color 0.0 1.0 0.0) (debug . #t) (subdivide . #t) (use-color . #f))

guile> bool-alist
((color 0.0 1.0 0.0) (debug . #t) (subdivide . #t) (use-color . #f))

(assq-remove! bool-alist 'some-other-key)
((color 1.0 0.0 0.0) (debug . #t) (subdivide . #t) (use-color . #f))
```

Please note that *this time* the procedure *does* modify the alist directly.
